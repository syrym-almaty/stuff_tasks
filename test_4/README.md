1. **Elastic Stack Components, Versions, and Licensing**:
   - **DB SFT6305 (Database Design. Introduction to SQL)**: Discusses database systems, which are a core part of Elastic Stack architecture, such as handling indices, documents, and shards .
   - **DB NET6301 (Introduction to Computer Networks)**: Elastic Stack involves distributed nodes and clusters, similar to what is taught in networking courses【3:0†Elastic Stack Cluster and Network Components】.

2. **Elastic Search Basic Concepts (Clusters, Shards, Replicas)**:
   - **DB SFT6301 (Algorithmization and Programming)**: Core programming concepts such as data structures (indices, shards, replicas) are relevant here .
   - **DB SFT6302 (Algorithms and Data Structures)**: This aligns well with how Elastic handles data through shards, indices, and replicas .

3. **Elastic Agent and Beats for Data Collection**:
   - **DB NET6304 (Cloud Computing and Virtualization)**: This course covers data handling, scaling, and optimization, all of which are part of Beats and Elastic Agent systems【3:3†Data Collection using Beats and Logstash】.
   - **PD SFT6315 (DevOps)**: Elastic's tools like Logstash and Beats are integral in CI/CD pipelines and DevOps, which is highly relevant here【3:3†Beats and Logstash Integration】.

4. **Search Capabilities (BM25, TF/IDF)**:
   - **DB SFT6322 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)**: BM25 and TF/IDF scoring models are essential in information retrieval and AI-based systems【3:4†Elastic Search Capabilities】.
   - **DB SFT6307 (Web Technologies)**: Search and ranking algorithms are applied in web technologies, directly linking with Elastic's search models .

5. **Machine Learning Integration in Elastic Stack**:
   - **DB SFT6378 (Introduction to Machine Learning)**: Machine learning integration for anomaly detection in Elastic Stack directly aligns with machine learning algorithms taught here【3:6†Machine Learning Integration】.

6. **Security, Role-Based Access, and SIEM Systems**:
   - **DB SEC6301 (Fundamentals of Information Security)**: Role-based security models in Elastic Stack are covered under Information Security topics【3:7†Security and Role-Based Access Control】.
   - **DB SFT6319 (Blockchain Technology)**: Securing distributed systems, such as Elastic clusters, parallels blockchain security practices【3:7†Security in Distributed Systems】.

7. **Data Visualization and Dashboards (Kibana, Grafana)**:
   - **PD SFT6388 (HCI - UI/UX in AR/VR)**: This course covers user interface design, which is critical in Kibana and Grafana dashboards【3:6†Data Visualization with Kibana】.
   - **PD SFT6389 (Virtual Reality Systems)**: Visualization in Elastic Stack, especially with complex datasets, ties into VR concepts【3:6†Visual Systems and Dashboards】.
